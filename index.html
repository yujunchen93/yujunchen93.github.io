<p>Git is an open source software (code that is free to use and develop by anyone) that provides version control.  Imagine that you are working with team of people on the same file, say you all have access to the same Dropbox directory.  You could all change the same file, but then when any of you syncs your changes then it will overwrite the other changes.  You could set times to edit, such as Don edits from 10am-12pm, Peggy edits from 12pm-2pm, and Joan edits from 2pm-4pm.  Or you could keep versions of files by changing the file name, so when I edit lucky_strikes_v3.py then I edit and save as lucky_strikes_v4.py.  These all seem cumbersome, and versioning systems provide a better way.  Git (and other versioning systems) provides the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A history of changes to files serving as a backup.</li>
<li>Developers can work concurrently and then with the help of git merge their changes.</li>
<li>Tracing what changes were made by who when.</li>
</ul>
